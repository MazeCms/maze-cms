 * Behavior is the base class for all behavior classes.

 * A behavior can be used to enhance the functionality of an existing component without modifying its code.
 * In particular, it can "inject" its own methods and properties into the component
 * and make them directly accessible via the component. It can also respond to the events triggered in the component
 * and thus intercept the normal code execution.
